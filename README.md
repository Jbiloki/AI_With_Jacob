# AI_With_Jacob: Learn AI Thursdays at 3pm-7pm CS-209 CSUF.

This is a class I teach at Cal State University Fullerton, as a passionate project. The school did not ask me to do this and I am not paid I just want to help others experience and have the opportunity to learn the thigns I love to do.

## Session Layout:

Typically spend the first half of the time lecturing on ideas or basic concepts. The last half is spent implementing the ideas we talked about or coming up with new problems to practice on. Most weeks I should have time to finish the lesson plan for the week but I am also open to ideas.

## Upcoming lessons:

__Within 2 weeks:__ 

Computer Vision - how does the basics work and how to get off the ground with OpenCV. Most likely the project will be on using a bounding box to detect objects....(Lots of basic ideas).

Tensorflow: How it works and how to use it. From here we can move on to neural nets and from there if there is interest we can talk about the specialized nets (i.e. RNN, CNN, LSTM nodes)

## Lessons

__Lessons will vary I will be adding a schedule here for what I plan to do for the week__

11/9/2017: Expect a lesson in computer vision most likely the bounding box classification but it will vary depending on my time to set up tonight.
